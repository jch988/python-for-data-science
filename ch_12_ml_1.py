Machine learning: leverage existing data to discover patterns and make decisions without being explicitly programmed

Some field that use ML:
- classification
- clustering
- predictive analysis
- learning associations
- anomaly detectoin
- image analysis
- natural language processing

This chapter:
- ML fundamentals
- example: Sentiment analysis
- example: Stock prices

Supervised learning
- labeled dataset to teach the model to tield a desired output when given unseen data
- ex. regression, classification

Unsupervised learning
- no training stage
- algorithm must learn on its own to discover patterns
- ex. association analysis (like id'ing items purchased together with Apriori algorithm)

How Machine learning works
- Data to learn from
- A statistical model to apply the data
- New previously unseen data to process
