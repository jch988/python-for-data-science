"R13Z1BSD70DMKJ","Dan","Have had this for one day and the cover is already coming off. Nothing a little glue won’t fix, and that’s the downside of paperbacks that you have to put weight on to keep closed, in my opinion.BUT the inner content is well worth it. I’ve been wanting to learn programming for years but have often gone away discouraged because the tutorials and teachers randomly start throwing complicated problems at you out of nowhere.Not so with this book. It eases you into each topic, breaks it down very clearly, and has exercises throughout that you can follow along with. Make sure you follow along! There are specific exercises throughout, but I highly recommend typing out the example code and playing around with it/experimenting on your own as well. Then by the time you get to the exercises you’ll have a good idea about how to approach it.STICK WITH IT! I decided I wanted to learn to program 10 years ago! I would start for a week and then quit when it got too complicated and felt overwhelming. Then I’d come back to it a few years later, and same thing. Then it hit me one day, “If I had pushed through the first time and been patient, I’d have 10 years of experience as a programmer right now. Do I want to look back in another 10 years and feel that way again? Or do I want to push through this time so in 10 years I’ll actually have the experience under my belt!?”Easy answer!Stick with it. Be patient with yourself if things get too complicated or you “feel too dumb” to get it. If you hit a block, go back a few pages and go through it again. Everyone is selling “learn ____ quick!” books these days. It’s a good way to get random chunks of knowledge but a terrible way to master it. So be patient!And get this book. :). It makes things very simple to understand and really holds your hand through everything.","Reviewed in the United States on July 5, 2019","Great inner content! Not that great outer quality.

I'm only four chapters into the book and I gotta say - Python is finally making sense to me! I've tried reading ""Automate the Boring Stuff with Python"" and I have no doubt that it's a good book. However, for me, it was not a good starting point and I found myself lost trying to read through the first few chapters - maybe I'll re-read ""Automate the Boring Stuff with Python"" afterwards after I finish ""Python Crash Course"". I'll do a follow-up review of this book when I'm done, but that won't be for a while; I'm going at my own pace and ensuring that I understand each topic and lesson.

"R17D6VX0MH3SZY","Dear MR.J","What is good about it? It teaches you the basics of Python But it does not have any advanced materials inside.  Evey little example is well explained. It has a lot of examples are presented. It also asked readers to do exercises after concept.However, I wish it comes with an answer for those after chapter exercises. Otherwise, it becomes meaningless because you won't know if you got it or not. Overall, well explained but somewhat too much explanation. Thus, this might be good for people who do not have any programming skill. Also, words are simple and straightforward.Update: Thanks to the author reply, there are solutions online. But I still think it explained things too much. Thus, costed too much reading for a simple concept.","Reviewed in the United States on June 29, 2019","Good for beginner but does not go too far or deep",4,"","105"

It  was apparently only held on by two narrow strips of glue on the first and last pages, and no glue holding it to the actual spine!The book contents itself are pretty good, but it does stay fairly simple. I bought the book because of the format of the examples, with code, point by point descriptions of the code elements, and then the output.  Some of the examples don't go very deep.

"R1GFEEVA2BFHUP","Stephen R. Roberts","I write firmware/software professionally in C/C++/C#.  Recently I started learning Python and BASH.  Got this book to learn Python, the book was a bit long winded. If I was a newbie I'd want it to be wordy.If you're a pro trying to pick up Python as new language in your arsenal, you'll have to read through a lot of fluff that you'd learn in your intro the programming classes in college.  The information isn't wrong, and the examples work, but....man...it's a long read.  I believe the book could probably be cut in half if the author removed the fluff.Why the 3 stars?  Most books about learning have all the basics listed in a single chapter, so people with experience can just read it real quick and move on to the more complex ideas.  This book interweaves the basics through out the entire book, which for me was a mind boring read (IMHO).","Reviewed in the United States on January 14, 2021","Truely for the person that doesn't know how to program",3,"","16"
"R37T2H59DR3WSL","Zerono","Wanted to add in a few tips, so beginners don't get discouraged. Just started reading this book yesterday, and immediately I ran into an issue with getting Sublime Text to work properly. If you're having the same problem, here's what's going wrong. On page 9, the author mentions that you can skip the part that says to create a ""New Build System"" if Python 3 is running correctly. If you were like me and you did not skip that part, then you might run into some issues. When you get to ""print(""Hello Python world!"")"" and go into Tools/Build System, choose ""Python,"" DO NOT choose ""Python3."" By creating a ""Python3.sublime-build"" you are creating an extra, and unnecessary, choice under ""Build System."" Also, the program will not run if you choose ""Python3"" that you've created. So skip the part that says to create ""Python3.sublime-build.""When the author says to create a folder called ""python_work,"" you can create that folder anywhere, but you should actually create it on your Desktop because he later references it on the Desktop. Any file saved as "".py"" is similar to files saved as .docx, .xlsl, or .txt, so don't worry about messing things up or crashing your program; it's just another file. You can move that folder and file around, and it will still work, just like any other Word file.Also, when you see "">>>"" it means that you need to run in terminal session. Go back and read page 4 or 6. Or click on the main Python 3.10 (64-bit) application, to go directly to Python terminal window.Lastly, remember that this book was written in 2018-2019, so the author is using Python 3.7.2. We are currently on 3.10.2. Certain things may look and function a bit differently, but the program language and concept will remain the same.print(""Good luck and happy coding!"")","Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2022","Tips for beginners",5,"","8"
"R3DBVATU7A3OA3","alrightalrightalright","I am about 8 chapters into this book. So, I haven’t finished it yet, but I wanted to give my thoughts so far.I had been hesitant to try to learn programming. I am an adult learner, and I was scared that it was complicated and hard. Other methods I had tried (YouTube videos, Udemy courses, iPhone apps) didn’t teach me things I felt I needed to know as a complete beginner. So I gave up each time. I still had so many questions, and not the kinds of questions you want to have as a beginner. Usually it’s a bunch of “why’s” or “how’s”. I would get discouraged and give up, because how could you advance when you’re really not even sure what you’re doing in the first place?I recently got the itch to try again. I have always known about this book, so I came back to it first. I am SO glad I did.I can’t remember the last time I was so impressed with a non-fiction book. The information here is intelligently structured, expertly delivered, and easy to digest. Every time I feel like I have a question (one of the why’s or how’s), I suddenly find that the question is being answered almost at the same time as I am asking them. It makes you feel like the author is a bit of a mind reader.I’ve been progressing really well by going through this book. I do no more than one chapter per day so that I have time to digest, then come back to the next chapter which builds upon the last - forcing you to practice what you’ve already learned. I can’t believe I find myself easily spitting out some of the code, and even incorporating what I’ve learned in ways that the book hasn’t gotten to yet. Oops?For anyone who might read this review, I have a couple of suggestions…1. Don’t worry about what computer you have, and don’t worry about setting up a developer environment yet. Start by using a cloud-based IDE like Repl.it. It’s free. It is SO easy to use. It gives “hints” to complete your code, as well as what to fix when something is wrong. It also has built-in shortcuts to help you code a little faster - some of them I’m still learning.2. Get the book spiral bound for $6 at Staples. I hate when books won’t lay flat, especially when I’m so actively using them. Now that mine is spiral bound, I can easily go back and forth from book to computer without worrying about the pages flipping on me. I also don’t need a bookmark anymore. I just leave the book open to where I left off.To the author:My only wish is that the exercises, or “Try this” sections, were a little more structured at the beginning to reinforce some of the lessons. Since I’ve reached chapter 8, I find myself wishing I had just sat down and practiced writing list after list, then dictionary after dictionary (as an example), etc. The subtle differences are everything in programming, and even though I know I will catch on with more experience, I would feel more confident if I had them down a little more at this stage.Final notes:After 8 Chapters, I already found myself looking for other books by the same author so I could continue building on what this book teaches me, knowing that I was in good hands. Sadly, this is the only book this author has done on the subject, but I feel fortunate to have it.","Reviewed in the United States on January 30, 2022","So good",5,"","6"
"R3NY3KXV8N46K7","Owen C. Marshall","With the lockdown from the global pandemic, I have been forced to work from home like many other people. Since my usual job involved supporting hardware, this meant I was going to be stuck! Fortunately, my boss said that if I could spend my time learning skills useful to the lab, I could count the hours doing that. I asked whether learning Python would count. I told him that I would try to create scripts to monitor my hardware from home. He said that was acceptable.I have some programming experience, but it has been years since I coded, and then it was usually for relatively basic tasks in undergrad. I was looking for something that would not insult my intelligence, but that would still be interesting enough to keep me on task. So, after searching around I found this book. I saw the highly rated reviews. I skimmed the language that the author used in the sample. I read the table of contents and saw that the second part of the book consisted of creating games in order to solidify the skills learned.Yes! This sounded perfect.I have not been disappointed.The book walks the reader through setting up (checking if Python is on the computer already, downloading it if necessary, using an IDE and what that is, etc). And then it moves on to the usual basic programming. The writing is clear. I had no problems with the examples and found the practice problems to be well chosen. I also liked the way that the author encouraged good practices such as documentation and testing.I am currently in Part 2 of the book and have been working on the first project, a game called Alien Invasion which is basically a version of Space Invaders. I am definitely enjoying that. And I can see how some of the skills I learn from this could transfer over into monitoring my equipment. Reading files, taking user input, opening windows, drawing on the screen, making calculations, all of these things are necessary for the game, and for my own goals.I personally never had any problems, but I also noticed that the author's website includes cheat sheets, solutions, and errata, not to mention the files suggested for the projects.I am not sure if this book is for an absolute beginner. My experience is too far from that for me to be a good judge. But I can say that a person with basic programming knowledge and no prior knowledge of Python found it to be a great resource.","Reviewed in the United States on May 7, 2020","Easy to Follow, Good Intro for Self Learner",5,"","8"
"R32IHODPYQN8CD","N8","I've had some programming experience in the past.  I've written very basic Perl and Python programs in the past, and have a solid understanding of the basics, such as strings, variables, functions, statements, etc.I got the book ""Learning Python"" and started going through it and was entirely lost; the book mostly focuses on using Python Interpreter for most of the examples, which made it confusing for me to follow along.This book, Python Crash Course is one of the best books I've ever worked with in learning to program anything.  The author explains everything in a very detailed, yet simplistic way, and even puts numbers next to the areas he's explaining, so that the reader can understand what area of the code is being explained.In addition, the book has numerous exercises to do at the end of each chapter that really give the reader a clear grasp of the subject matter that has been presented.  Most of the time, I tend to skip over these, because they seem so tedious and boring in other books....not so in this book.  The author tells you to go find a famous quote you like, and then use that to create an exercise where you're manipulating strings (as an example).I'd have to say that so far, this is one of the best books I've ever worked with in regards to learning programming.  If you're new to programming, and don't know what a variable is verses a string, this is a great book to start with.  If you're like myself, and have a basic understanding of programming syntax, but have some places that are still confusing (maybe you know how to get something to work, but not know why it works for example), this is also a great book.Best book I've read in regards to learning Python, by far.","Reviewed in the United States on March 28, 2021","Very detailed and clearly explained",5,"","5"

"R2IOYW8GNJDUAZ","G. W.","So far I've only made it to ""for loops"" chapter 4; but I think this is a really good book. I had an online class from a local University and this book has covered somethings that the class did not. Not that what the book covered and the class didn't has been major; but is interesting that only having reached chapter 4 in the book that there are things the class left out. So far the biggest change between this book and the class I took is that the book does a much better job of explaining for loops. I even watched a video on Youtube to teach you Python with no experience and even that did not do as good a job of explaining why a for loop is written the way it is. Being that the class I took was online and was one of those classes done in half the time (warp speed) I didn't bother to ask why a for loop is written the way it is I just wrote it and followed the class examples (and yes I passed the class with an A but Python is not my first programming language). I feel way more confident in learning Python after the book did such a good job of explaining for loops that as I continue with the book I believe it will explain things better then the class I took or the video I watched. On a side note the class I took, as all college classes I have taken do, required a book and that book just didn't do a good job of explaining for loops (go figure). You might be wondering why am I using this book if I took an online class and the answer is it has been awhile since I took that class so I need a refresher. Also the college that I took that class from doesn't offer another a following Python class to take unless you sign up for a degree program (and I already have a degree I just want to become proficient in Python). I would recommend that if you want to learn Python to use in a job to take at least one class from a college or another way to get proof that you learned Python other than studying it on your own. Also another reason to learn from a book with no class attached to it is you can learn at your own pace. Now I could learn from the book that I bought for the college course since the class only went so far into the book; but I just didn't find that book to be very well written and full of information one doesn't really need to learn how to program with Python. I feel like a ""college"" course book has a lot of bloat while a book like this one is more straight forward. A book like this one survives and sells or not because it is good etc while a college course book is chosen by the teacher or school regardless of the reviews it got. So after this extremely long review I would recommend this book; but I think one does need something (a class, certificate etc) to show proof that one has at least some Python knowledge outside of ones own studying.","Reviewed in the United States on December 26, 2021","Recommend getting, but also get proof of Python knowledge elsewhere (see below)",5,"","2"
"R2M2AT6AHNOA5V","geekandglitter","I am a beginner/intermediate Python programmer with many holes in my knowledge; thus I am using this book both for reference and for systematic self-teaching.I've never seen such a thorough, comprehensive, and easy to use table of contents and index in any technical book.  This makes the book as easy to use as a reference as it is a teaching tool through building projects.This author, who is a trained teacher, clearly has a rationale behind laying out every concept. It's no wonder it's been translated into several languages and is a best seller.The form factor, typeface, and spacing are also carefully planned, as each page draws the eye in.Another note of interest is that I, perhaps like many people, tend not to want to learn through building someone else's projects. I just want to learn what I need to build my own! Thus when I take online courses, I avoid those that are project based.  But a physical book can make it worthwhile to build the projects, because doing so makes it an even better reference afterward. That is, the projects become old friends rather than throw-away. I only thought of this now, looking at this book, because I am confident that if any teacher/author can make me build their project, this author can.As programmers, we all heavily use google to find answers. I am happy to now have a physical book at my side. And just to make this book even better, it comes with lots of free meta materials which the author is actively maintaining.

"R3F5MIDEUO5COR","Jimmy R. Russell","This book didn't feel like a crash course but didn't feel like a textbook either. The author briskly reviewed some key basic concepts and gave the odd pointer here or there, and the book promptly moved on to some real-world examples. The author also gives you an overview of what is out there in the Python ecosystem, which is helpful because there is a lot out there. It is not like Java where everything you need is in the API. If you're like me and you had a background in programming already, that's exactly what you were looking for. If you are completely new to programming and you've decided to learn in Python, this would still be a good book to buy but you may want to buy another book to complement it.","Reviewed in the United States on October 8, 2020","Great book.

"R1E5M1YLM2FZSP","idontwanttomakeone","My background is in JS, so I was looking for something that would both help me navigate installing Python3, learning the language syntax and differences in rules, and delve a little deeper in classes & objects.So far, it's clear that this is set up for absolute beginners, and I wouldn't call it a ""crash"" course. It's extremely thorough about walking you through common syntax errors you'll probably make on your own. I do like that it encourages you to play with breaking the code, which is absolutely necessary for learning how to code, but it's a little hand-holdy. I was expecting the guidance to loosen up as you went on, but as of chapter 6 out of the 11 chapters that introduce the topics, it's still very sheltered.I'd suggest people wanting a little more challenge/for things to stick a little longer read the first ""A Simple ___"" section whenever a topic is introduced, then jump to the exercises. See what you can accomplish there just from seeing the example code, and if you run into trouble, then go back through all of the ""how to do this exact thing"" stuff.Using the book this way, it's been a great reference book, and a quick read. I wish more complex ideas were introduced earlier, like conditionals/loops, so that the exercises could introduce more problem-solving than you can get with just print earlier, but I'm looking forward to the projects section.Oh, and yeah the binding did pop off on day 1.

"R3G7MCXLOZGDTO","Some Guy","This is probably one of the best introductory programming books I've ever tried. Back when I was an undergraduate, I learned Pascal (yup, they still taught it at that point), C, and C++.  Neither the professors or the textbooks were very good at explaining...well...anything. Luckily, I was able to figure things out for myself, but it really left a sour taste in my mouth about programming (I've done scripting professionally, but it wasn't my primary role).Fast forward to now. I have one foot in each of 2 worlds - behavioral science and IT (networking and security). Both worlds use Python. I decided to get this book and finally sit down and learn it (I was briefly introduced to Python when I was an undergraduate and asked why we didn't have a class in it, I would have preferred it). This book has very clear, concrete examples and you learn by doing. For the first half (or a little more), you'll learn the basics of what you need to navigate the language. You'll do short exercises to lock in what you learn. Later on the book, you'll actually work on larger, more involved projects and the author guides you through with excellent explanations.Needless to say, I picked up Python faster than any language before it. I've come to really like the No Starch Press books as I find them (in general) to be well-written  and clear.","Reviewed in the United States on January 1, 2021","Great",5,"","2"

"RCJ1TA9XB5WWU","Samson","The first 8 chapters are presented at a good pace with lots of exercises.  (Work the exercises).  Exercises are challenging the first time you see them.  Ch 9 (Classes) didn't stick the first time through, but maybe it's the material ??  I expect to have to repeat it several times.There is a BIG step up into chapter 12 -- the first large project -- Alien Invasion.  Found myself in a position of typing in the code, and understanding the code, but knowing I could not write the code.  What makes it especially difficult was -- to save space -- the author plugged snippets of code into partial program listings while telling you in the text to delete sections of code.  I would suggest that's a very poor way of changing the code as it's extremely easy for the user to mess up.  I got frustrated to the point of just quitting several times working through this portion of the book.  This cost it a star.Also, the code ran extremely slow -- taking half an hour to load.  Not sure what that's about.  Looked online but couldn't find anybody with a similar problem.  Like everybody else said -- the binding is awful -- but the content is really good.

"R33V7E2SUYVWDT","James PJ","First off, I want to enter a quote from page 173: ""This brings you to an interesting point in your growth as a programmer.  When you wrestle with questions like these, you're thinking at a higher logical level rather than a syntax-focused level.  Your're thinking not about Python, but about how to represent the real world in code.""  This quote reminds me of another: ""the best programming is done by programmers immersed in the environment they are writing for.  I was lucky to be immersed and programming in a clinical environment.  I've been out of that (programming) environment for about eight years and grabbed this book because I'd been missing this kind of thinking.

"R3A8P4T32WC2IB","Patrick Hoang","It took me some time to get around to learn Python scripting, but so far it is simple and straight forward in how to program in Python.  If you want to get in further depth, it would definitely be good to check out O'Reillys books for Python as they are more in depth technically(have not used it, but my coworker has told me so).Reason why I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5, is due to the simplicity of the practice problems and wording.  I wish it was more challenging and utilizes the previous chapters we learned and continues to implement it in the current chapters, as an ongoing and repetitive learning.  If the author followed the practice problems ""C Programming Language"" by Dennis M. Ritchie and Brian W. Kernighan(very good C programming book by the way), then it would definitely be more challenging and allow the person to think and be more creative.  The problems the author gives are okay, but I used them to think of more creative things.Definite good investment in having a physical copy, reading it and going through the book and examples.

I'll definitely look for the next Python book from this author.","Reviewed in the United States on December 31, 2021","Great for beginners!",5,"","2"

This is clearer and more accessible than any other book I've seen.My only request, Mr. Matthes, is that you write the same book but for R.

They were all good, HFP being the best of the group. But this book, in my opinion, is perfect. This is a lifelong programmer taking you through a perfectly logical learning course, laying a foundation from which to build upon. Just go through it slowly and methodically, type everything in the book along the way and ponder it, and I have no doubt you will learn this language and use it capably.The other thing I love is that he never goes more than a few pages without pausing for exercises, and the exercises are never too difficult. It's exactly what was just discussed, and the solutions are on his website if you need them (I rarely did bc of how well the material was presented).I emphatically recommend this.

At the end of the book, there are 3 hands-on projects, a game to develop, a data visualization project and a web app using Django.

At least it makes it easier to keep the book open at the page you are reading while using your other two hands on the computer keyboard. The instructions on how to complete the installation of Python and Sublime Text so they would work together was not clear enough for me – I had to get help before I could make anything work. But then, progress through the chapters seems slow, especially if you are going to do all the exercises: The explanations are clear enough but I kept on wanting to look ahead to find out how to do something the book hadn't got to yet, and this is where I found the most frustrating inadequacy: the index is not helpful enough. If you want to find out how to copy a list to a file, for example, you won't find  any reference to that in the index.  Searching the internet is much more productive. Perhaps I was looking for a reference book rather than  ""crash course"". I needed the book but it didn't work as a crash course for me.

"R2QFGLYLMI2STM","Taylor","## Allow me to preface by saying I’m only 5 chapters in and will update my review if need be if my opinion changes.Going into this I have tried learning python through other books and online courses but always struggled keeping everything straight and understanding how the code actually worked. Sometimes I feel that Python is so easy to write it’s hard to understand exactly what you’re even doing if you have no other language experience. So I actually spent a few months learning Java to understand the basics since Java sort of holds your hand in how you have to write so much more out like declaring every variable. I picked up this book to try and get back into Python and so far I’m LOVING this book. The author does a great job explaining what you need to know and nothing more. Straight to the point while still explaining each like of code very clearly. I’m excited to get to work on the project(s) later on in the book. If I still like it I will most likely order the publishers other Python book about “automating the boring stuff”.","Reviewed in the United States on May 15, 2019","GREAT for beginners- Simple, clear, and easy to understand.",5,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71XbvCKKzGL.jpg

While it uses Python to teach you to code it also teaches clean programming skills that apply to most other languages.The book is neatly broken down into two parts.  The first half focuses on installing and using the Python language.  It teaches using data, whiles, ifs, loops, accepting user input for interactivity – all the basic programming stuff.The second part features three projects: a video game (like Space Invaders), data visualization techniques to make graphs and charts, and an interactive web application.The book lists other online resources and has a well thought out Table of Contents and Index.  Appendix A covers installation issues and troubleshooting on various platforms.  Appendix B covers Text Editors including more on the recommended Sublime Text editor and Integrated Development Environments (IDE). Appendix C gives resources and ideas to take your coding beyond the book. The final Appendix shows how to use Git for version control in your programming.It’s a great resource and not a surprise that so many copies have sold.  Recommended.","Reviewed in the United States on June 3, 2019","Python, yes but the skills apply to other languages",4,"","6"
"R3SKEKK5JPVAG1","Robert V.","Of all of the things I've used to learn Python over the past 2 years, this book was the absolute worst. I think it's popular because it gives people a false sense that they understand the material, but all it does is set you up for failure when you try and do something that is slightly different from one of the examples in the book. As an example of what I mean, the book spends pages talking about how to create a list of favorite pizza toppings (something that should really take a couple of lines of explanation), and then there is an exercise to create a list of your favorite places in the world. Now if you know no Python, and I say this is a list of pizza toppings in Python, I would argue that you could probably give me a list of favorite cities in Python without ever having the slightest idea of what a Python list is. Pepperoni....let's replace that with Denver.........Meatballs.....you're now New York. It would be one thing if this was just the introductory exercise on lists and the exercises then progress to get more difficult. But this is literally true of every exercise in the entire book.","Reviewed in the United States on July 7, 2019","Trivial examples and exercises",1,"","7"

I got it quite a while ago and got to the Dictionary section, I think. Then I lost interest. I started in on it again maybe a week ago because I'm trying to become employable. I started from the beginning and I'm almost to Dictionaries and I'm doing pretty well with it.The pacing is perfect for me and I love how things are explained. I think there was one time when something wasn't clear, but maybe I'm just dense.I see some people have had problems with the quality of the book. Mine has been in my backpack and hauled out in cafes several times and flipped through on a bookstand quite a bit. I have 2 other No Starch Press books and the quality on those are great as well, so it seems there's a bad batch on the loose.So yeah, loving this book so far.

"R16DJ5I4NUYH99","merchant","Let me say that I have tried my hands at programming many times. I started with C, C++, Java, etc. years ago. Most books were dry and provided so many details that would overwhelm an average beginner like me. I would quit after spending time as I would lose confidence and had to move on with other life problems that came along. I didn't see myself spending more time, as I knew I would fail to complete.Not this book, however. Eric explains each concept in a simple, easy to understand manner. Through his examples, he keeps readers aware of how and where they can apply to the concept just learned, and his Try it Yourself exercise goes an extra step in solidifying the concepts.Programming is hard, but one can learn and master, I feel,  if you have a teacher like Eric, or read this book.Eric, a big thank you!

"R1UE6WOP54V09P","Erik T.","This book came recommended in several searches on ""Best Python Book for EXPERIENCED programmers"". Simply put, while this book appears quite well written for complete novices who have never programmed in another language before, it's absolutely not suitable for experienced programmers who seek to learn Python.I came expecting the first chapter to give me some clarity on the pros and cons of Anaconda vs. direct install of Python, which libraries were most essential, and advice on which of the several Python IDEs might best suit my circumstances. Instead I found a long section introducing the concept of what a text editor is, and an entire chapter introducing the concept of what a variable is.I gave it 4 stars because the problem was with the advice I received, not with the author, who seems to have done an excellent job of writing a book for people with zero programming experience.

"R2BFFGZV24N1JR","Amazon Customer","A growing trend affecting books purchased from Amazon is the fact they are 'Print On Demand' and are very poor quality.Within a week of purchasing and about 120 pages read, the cover detached itself from the body... Totally unacceptable! This is one of several books that I have purchased from Amazon over the last couple of years that has suffered from some sort of printing/binding issue. Problems range from splines plitting, covers detaching or delaminating, covers also suffer with excess curl...I have many books that are 20 to 30 years old that are in better condition that ones that are virtually new by comparison... It's not difficult to make books well, we've been doing it for hundreds of years!The content of the book seems well written so far and is suitable for beginners of the Python language and also for more experienced programmers that come from different programming backgrounds...I will think twice now before ordering books from Amazon now and try to find alternatives that have been printed and bound in a professional way that should last a lifetime!","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on June 12, 2020","Very poor quality book...",1,"","73"

"RTD6CIVYHJUR9","Cetinszn","I've mainly purchased this book to have a good source in details but it's more suitable for beginners. I haven't experienced any problems about the print quality, unlike other comments I'm very happy that there isn't any coloured text or black background code snippets. I found more beneficial to take your own notes or highlight manually the parts you had practised. It's easier to look back and find your notes on the book. Otherwise it's not different than reading people's snippets on stackoverflow.  Paper quality is good. Nothing to complain but I wish I had chance have a sneak peek to know the level of information. If you just started to learn python this book is great for you. But if you already finished a beginner python course or watch CS50 week 6 on YouTube, you don't need this book for learning. But you can benefit the projects part. I also purchased O'Reilly python cookbook from Amazon and if you need advanced information to solve complex problems you should check them too.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on November 29, 2020","More suitable for beginners",5,"","11"
"R231FQ2YWY2Y4P","Eric Millington","Python is a pretty easy language to get going with and this book 'holds your hand' very well.As you work through the 'try it yourself' sections you will find yourself thinking ""I've already done this before"" but that's ok because it's just reinforcing your understanding, by the end of chapter 4 you'll be creating your own 'lists' of data in their millions, slicing them up, pulling individual elements out, cycling through your lists using 'for' loops, formatting your output using 'F' strings etc etc, and you'll be able to code these things without opening the book as a reference!  I know there's a lot of book left for me to work through but I'm super confident I'll be fine with it!","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on February 1, 2020","Superbly paced and not overwhelming at all!",5,"","14"

I am planning on purchasing further books in the future.The only issue I have come across is not from the book, rather python itself. Unfortunately the latest version of python (3.8) does not have pygame (and the dev version doesn't fully work) so you need to downgrade for the games section.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on May 1, 2020","This is a great book!",5,"","11"
"R20JH5IBYHSL5U","Mr. Michael Gover","This could be used by a complete beginner to coding, in which case it's worth working carefully through all the examples.  It holds your hand as you work through the basics.  It then moves on to projects, data visualisation, and web applications.  If you have some programming experience you might feel able to skip bits.  You will really want to use a text editor like Sublime.  Theoretically this is is free but constant reminders will drive you nuts so you will end up spending £50 buying it (but it IS excellent).You will need a Pritt Stick as the binding keeps coming off, but I can live with that.  In any case you would not want to invest in a fancy hard back binding for a book that in the nature of things will become obsolete in three to four years.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on August 22, 2020","Steady pace with lots of worked examples, a beginner to programming could start with this.",5,"","3"

"R17LS13IMCSR67","J SIMPSON","I like the format (specific lines given numbers so detailed explanations of each part can be explained clearly and simply ) and the no nonsense dive into each aspect is in useful. Not only does it give you lots of examples and exercises to do at every stage but (I'm only 50% through it yet) the examples also include typical mistakes so you learn what to look out for. Which is invaluable to a python programmer just starting out.It will be a valauble reference. All too often I've found texts and videos either throw you in the deep end expecting you'll figure it out or keep you forever in the paddling pool.
